Without a customizable option that fit all the owners' individual needs and requirements, they decided to create their own distribution and fulfillment center. Midwest Logistics was founded by professionals with a long history in 3rd party logistics to include only the best, modern business philosophies and discard the antiquated "business as usual" techniques still common in the eCommerce fulfillment industry.= Who can I ask for help setting the plugin up?<a href="mailto:support@midwest-logistics.com" >support@midwest-logistics.com</a>= When are orders sent to Midwest Logistics?In the plugin settings you specify the order status you want used to trigger pushing orders to Midwest Logistics.= Does the plugin support Variable Products?Yes, do not specify a Midwest SKU on the parent product and specify it on each variation.= Does the plugin support Bundles or Stacks?We have tested WooCommerce Product Bundles: <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/" target="_blank">https://woocommerce.com/products/product-bundles/</a>   Plugins that handle Bundles or Stacks and submit each item individually on the order should work. = What if an order has an error when it is submitted to Midwest?The order will have a notice at the top. You can use the Communication Log to determine what the error was. If it was a communication error or a missing SKU, you can resubmit the order from the order screen or utilize the Orders With Errors report to send it again.= What is the Sync Inventory Setting and how does it work?This specifies if the plugin will query Midwest for current stock level. If set to yes, the plugin will check Midwest hourly for current inventory. It will set the stock level and automatically assign in-stock or out of stock as needed.= Can I have custom shipping types?Yes, Go to WooCommerce->Settings->Shipping->Midwest Logistics. You can enable Rate Mapping and select your custom shipping type and what actual shipping method you want Midwest to use.= Do you support any other shipping plugins?Yes, We support both WooCommerce UPS and WooCommerce USPS plugins. To map Midwest Logistics rates to UPS or USPS go to WooCommerce->Settings->Shipping->Midwest Logistics. You must enable "Enable Rate Mapping" to view your shipping zones in WooCommerce. The plugin will list your current zones and any instances you have setup for those zones. If USPS or UPS is added then the service options you have selected will be shown and allow you to map a service to a Midwest Logistics service. If no service is selected the default shipping service will be used when adding orders to Midwest Logistics.WooCommerce UPS: <a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/ups-shipping-method/?quid=f28172ffbac717f6da026c7efe2aa79b">https://woocommerce.com/products/ups-shipping-method/?quid=f28172ffbac717f6da026c7efe2aa79b</a>WooCommerce USPS:<a href="https://woocommerce.com/products/usps-shipping-method/?quid=f28172ffbac717f6da026c7efe2aa79b">https://woocommerce.com/products/usps-shipping-method/?quid=f28172ffbac717f6da026c7efe2aa79b</a> == Changelog ==== Changelog === 1.1.25 (2024-02-21) =* Update - updated stock to improve stock checking for new products or existing products when a customer first installs the plugin.= 1.1.22 (2024-01-17) =* Update - removed customer id from settings.
